## Abstract
This QIP defines a protocol for storing contract ABIs on-chain along with contract code.

## Motivation
In the traditional EVM, the contract ABI is not stored on-chain. It is left to
contract developers to supply the ABI to users externally, who may then use
that ABI to interact with a smart contract on-chain. This results in confusion
about where to find an ABI to interact with a contract, and even attack vectors
if malicious actors are able to trick users into using the wrong ABI with a
given contract.

This specification defines a simple mechansims for storing the contract ABI on
chain at the tail end of the contract code. The EVM will ignore the ABI when
reading the contract code, but it will be available to users who need it for
their interface.

## Specification
When deploying a contract, contract ABI shall be appended to contract code. The
concatenation is what will be deployed to the chain as contract code.
